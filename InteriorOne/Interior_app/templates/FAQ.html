                </li>
                <p>
                <h4>ANSWER:</h4>

                During your initial consultation with an interior designer, you will discuss your likes and dislikes.
                This will help narrow the field. Photos are also helpful in choosing an ultimate design. How you want to
                furnish the space, as well as how it will be used can make a difference in style selection.

                    <h4>Can I afford interior design help from a professional?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>
                <h4>ANSWER:</h4>

                You can often save money by hiring an interior designer. Industry professionals have access to discounts
                from multiple businesses that they can pass on to their clients. Also, you can avoid costly mistakes and
                purchases by utilizing a designerâ€™s professional services up front, rather than during a redo of a space
                that did not suit your needs or desires.

                    <h4>Is it worth it to get interior design advice and services for a small living space?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>
                <h4>ANSWER:</h4>

                An interior designer knows how to use furnishings, colors, and art to make a small space look larger. A
                strategically placed mirror or light colors of paint can do wonders for increasing visual depth.
                Additionally, breaking a long narrow room into different seating areas can add dimension. You will be
                amazed at how well the right interior design can turn your small living space into a functional and
                homey environment.

                <li>
                    <h4>When you design a room, what is the most important interior design advice you give?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>
                <h4>ANSWER:</h4>

                Think about the primary use of the room, and who will see it. Your bedroom is your haven and should be
                inviting to you. A living room or dining room that will be seen by many people is where you may want to
                make a statement. How do you need the room to function for you? People who have very little storage
                space may want to incorporate pieces of furniture that double as storage spaces. In an open environment,
                it is essential to have an interior design that flows from one room to the next.

                <li>
                    <h4>What is the most important factor when designing a room?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>
                <h4>ANSWER:</h4>

                Having a clear vision of what you want is essential. If you are not sure, the services of the interior
                designer can be priceless. Before you go out and start buying pieces of furniture and artwork that do
                not mix, get help narrowing down your design and theme. Some colors compliment while others clash. You
                want your living space to reflect your personality and be functional and inviting at the same time.

                    <h4>How do I decide between wood, tile, carpet, and other flooring options?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>
                <h4>ANSWER:</h4>

                An in-depth consultation with an interior designer about your desires, goals, and lifestyle will yield
                important answers. As a result, you will be able to determine what flooring, wallcoverings, window
                treatments, and furnishings will best suit your needs.
